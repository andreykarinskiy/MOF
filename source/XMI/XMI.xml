            The Add class represents an addition to a target object in this document or
            other documents. The target is constrained to
            reference only one object. The position attribute indicates where to place the
            addition relative to other XML elements of
            that type within the target. The default, -1, indicates to add the new elements
            at the end of those elements for the target
            element. The addition attribute refers to the set of objects to be added. Both
            of these attributes have the tag
            org.omg.xmi.attribute set to “true.”

            The Documentation class contains information about the XMI document or stream
            being transmitted, for instance the
            owner of the document, a contact person for the document, long and short
            descriptions of the document, the exporter tool
            which created the document, the version of the tool, the date and time the
            document was created, and copyright or other
            legal notices regarding the document. The data type of all the attributes of
            Documentation is string except for the
            timestamp which is DateTime.

            The Extension class is designed to contain extended information outside the
            scope of the user model. Extensions are a
            multivalued attribute of the XMI class and may also be embedded in specific
            locations in an XMI document.

        <member name="T:XMI.Replace">
            <summary>
            The Replace class represents the removal of a target set of objects and the
            addition of the objects referred to in the
            replacement attribute. The position attribute indicates where to place the
            replacements relative to other XML elements of
            that type within their container (they should all be of the same XML type). The
            default, -1, indicates to add the new
            elements at the end of those elements for the target element. The replacement
            attribute refers to the objects that will
            replace the target elements. Both of these attributes have the tag org.omg.xmi.
            attribute set to “true.” Note that, unlike Delete, the replaced elements are 
            only removed from the container not deleted.

            The root level XML element for XMI documents containing only XMI data may be
            the XMI element, but it must be the
